A data scraping program for airbnb


Note that the name of the classes used change regularly on airbnb , so you should change them according to the latest airbnb website update.

Airbnb has invested a significant amount of  time to make sure   you cant scrape their website , but this scraper can handle it , it will show you the errors while running but will take care of them.
 
 
This program will uses by default all the cores of your computer , this can be changed in the class initialization.

You will need to include the user and password of mysql  installed on your computer since this program also creates a new database called airbnb.

Requires the chromedriver file , can be downloaded at : http://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads 
should be put in the same directory as the scraper to avoid unnecessary config
